### Automatic Analysis (Default)

Projects are automatically analyzed when created via the API:

```bash
POST /api/projects
{
  "title": "E-Commerce Platform",
  "description": "Full-stack application...",
  "discipline": "TECHNOLOGY",
  "technologies": ["Next.js", "PostgreSQL"],
  "grade": "A",
  "courseName": "Web Development"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "project": { ... },
  "message": "Project created successfully"
}
```

Analysis runs **asynchronously** in the background and updates the project within seconds.

---

### Manual Analysis

```typescript
import { analyzeProject } from '@/lib/ai-analysis'

const analysis = await analyzeProject({
  title: "Tesla Valuation Model",
  description: "DCF analysis with scenario planning...",
  discipline: "BUSINESS",
  skills: ["Financial Modeling", "Excel"],
  tools: ["Excel", "Bloomberg Terminal"],
  grade: "A",
  outcome: "Model predicted price within 5% accuracy"
})

console.log(analysis.overallScore)      // 87
console.log(analysis.innovationScore)   // 82
console.log(analysis.strengths)         // ["Strong analytical framework", ...]
console.log(analysis.summary)           // "Business project demonstrating..."
```

---

### Batch Analysis

Process multiple projects efficiently:

```typescript
import { analyzeBatchProjects } from '@/lib/ai-analysis'

const projects = [
  { title: "Project 1", discipline: "TECHNOLOGY", ... },
  { title: "Project 2", discipline: "DESIGN", ... },
  { title: "Project 3", discipline: "BUSINESS", ... }
]

const results = await analyzeBatchProjects(projects, {
  concurrency: 3,  // Process 3 at a time
  onProgress: (completed, total) => {
    console.log(`Analyzed ${completed}/${total} projects`)
  }
})

console.log(results.size)  // 3
console.log(results.get("Project 1").overallScore)  // 85
```

---

## 📈 Analysis Results

### AnalysisResult Interface

```typescript
interface AnalysisResult {
  // Scores (0-100)
  innovationScore: number
  complexityScore: number
  relevanceScore: number
  qualityScore: number
  overallScore: number

  // Additional metrics
  technicalDepth?: number

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required for AI-powered analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional: Configure model and parameters
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1500
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

### Without OpenAI API Key

The system will automatically fall back to heuristic analysis:

- ✅ Still provides all 5 scores
- ✅ Still generates insights and recommendations
- ✅ Based on project metadata (grade, tools, skills, outcomes)
- ⚠️ Less nuanced than AI analysis
- ⚠️ No natural language understanding

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### 1. Project Creation (Automatic)

File: `/frontend/app/api/projects/route.ts`

```typescript
// POST /api/projects
const project = await prisma.project.create({ ... })

// Trigger AI analysis asynchronously
runAIAnalysis(project.id, projectData)
  .catch(err => console.error('AI analysis failed:', err))

// Return immediately (don't block on analysis)
return NextResponse.json({ success: true, project })
```

### 2. Project Updates

The project is updated with analysis results:

```typescript
await prisma.project.update({
  where: { id: projectId },
  data: {
    innovationScore: analysis.innovationScore,
    complexityScore: analysis.complexityScore,
    relevanceScore: analysis.relevanceScore,
    qualityScore: analysis.qualityScore,
    overallScore: analysis.overallScore,

    aiSummary: analysis.summary,
    aiStrengths: analysis.strengths,
    aiImprovements: analysis.improvements,
    aiHighlights: analysis.highlights,

    aiAnalyzed: true,
    aiAnalyzedAt: new Date()
  }
})
```

### 3. Display in UI

Show analysis results on project cards and detail pages:

```tsx
<Card>
  <h3>{project.title}</h3>
  <Badge>Overall Score: {project.overallScore}/100</Badge>

  <div className="scores">
    <div>Innovation: {project.innovationScore}</div>
    <div>Complexity: {project.complexityScore}</div>
    <div>Quality: {project.qualityScore}</div>
  </div>

  <div className="insights">
    <h4>Strengths</h4>
    <ul>
      {project.aiStrengths?.map(s => <li>{s}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <h4>AI Summary</h4>
    <p>{project.aiSummary}</p>
  </div>
</Card>
```

## 🛠️ Extending the System

### Adding a New Discipline Analyzer

1. **Create detailed analyzer function:**

```typescript
export async function analyzeNewDiscipline(project: ProjectData): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
  const prompt = `Analyze this ${project.discipline} project:

  Title: ${project.title}
  Description: ${project.description}

  Evaluate on:
  1. Criterion 1 (0-100)
  2. Criterion 2 (0-100)
  ...

  Return JSON format.`

  try {
    const analysis = await callOpenAI(prompt)
    return { ...analysis, overallScore: calculateOverallScore(analysis) }
  } catch (error) {
    return heuristicNewDisciplineAnalysis(project)
  }
}

function heuristicNewDisciplineAnalysis(project: ProjectData): AnalysisResult {
  // Custom scoring logic
  return { /* scores and insights */ }
}
```

2. **Add to router:**

```typescript
export async function analyzeProject(project: ProjectData): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
  switch (project.discipline) {
    // ... existing cases
    case 'NEW_DISCIPLINE':
      return analyzeNewDiscipline(project)
    default:
      return analyzeGenericProject(project)
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test Technology project
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: user_123" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Project",
    "description": "Test description with technical details...",
    "discipline": "TECHNOLOGY",
    "technologies": ["React", "Node.js"],
    "grade": "A"
  }'

# Check project after a few seconds
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects/:projectId
# Should have aiAnalyzed: true and all scores populated
```

### Automated Testing

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { analyzeProject } from '@/lib/ai-analysis'

describe('AI Analysis System', () => {
  it('should analyze technology projects', async () => {
    const result = await analyzeProject({
      title: "Test App",
      description: "Full-stack application",
      discipline: "TECHNOLOGY",
      technologies: ["React", "Node.js"],
      grade: "A"
    })

    expect(result.overallScore).toBeGreaterThan(0)
    expect(result.strengths).toHaveLength(3)
    expect(result.summary).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

---

## 📝 Logging and Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging:

```
[AI Analysis] Starting analysis for project clx123abc
[AI Analysis] Analysis complete for project clx123abc: {
  overallScore: 87,
  innovationScore: 82,
  complexityScore: 85
}
[AI Analysis] Project clx123abc updated with analysis results
```

**Error handling:**
```
[AI Analysis] Failed for project clx123abc: OpenAI API error
Failed to update project after AI error: Database connection timeout
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**
   - Store `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment variables
   - Never expose in client-side code
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - OpenAI enforces rate limits (adjust `concurrency` in batch analysis)
   - Consider caching results for 24 hours

3. **Input Validation**
   - All project data is validated before analysis
   - Malicious inputs are sanitized

4. **Privacy**
   - Project descriptions sent to OpenAI
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
   - Consider on-premise models for sensitive data
