# Pricing Validation Strategy: Soft Skills Certification
## InTransparency Price Discovery & Willingness-to-Pay Testing

**Objective:** Validate ‚Ç¨99 one-time fee for soft skills certification BEFORE building the feature
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Budget:** ‚Ç¨1,000-2,000
**Success Criteria:** >40% of target users willing to pay ‚Ç¨99

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### The Pricing Question

**We need to answer:**
1. Will students pay for soft skills certification? (Binary: Yes/No)
2. If yes, how much? (‚Ç¨25? ‚Ç¨50? ‚Ç¨99? ‚Ç¨150?)
3. One-time fee vs subscription? (‚Ç¨99 once OR ‚Ç¨9/month)
4. What features justify the price? (Certification? Priority in search? Analytics?)

### Current Hypothesis

**Proposed Price:** ‚Ç¨99 one-time
**Rationale:**
- High enough to be credible ("free = not valuable")
- Low enough to be student-affordable (< 1 week of part-time work)
- Competitive with similar services (Py metrix ~‚Ç¨15/test for B2B, extrapolated to B2C)

**Alternative Models to Test:**
- ‚Ç¨49 one-time (lower barrier)
- ‚Ç¨9/month recurring (Netflix model)
- ‚Ç¨0 with ‚Ç¨25/month Premium upgrade (freemium)

## üìä PART 1: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

### What It Is
A validated market research technique to find optimal price point by asking 4 key questions.

### The 4 Questions

**Send to:** 200+ students on early access list

**Question 1:** At what price would you consider certified soft skills assessment to be **so expensive that you would not consider buying it**, no matter what?
- ‚Ç¨0-25
- ‚Ç¨26-50
- ‚Ç¨51-75
- ‚Ç¨76-100
- ‚Ç¨101-150
- ‚Ç¨151-200
- ‚Ç¨200+

**Question 2:** At what price would you consider certified soft skills assessment to be **priced so low that you'd feel the quality couldn't be very good**?
- ‚Ç¨0-10
- ‚Ç¨11-25
- ‚Ç¨26-40
- ‚Ç¨41-60
- ‚Ç¨61-75
- ‚Ç¨76+

**Question 3:** At what price would you consider certified soft skills assessment **starting to get expensive**, but you'd still consider it?
- ‚Ç¨0-25
- ‚Ç¨26-50
- ‚Ç¨51-75
- ‚Ç¨76-100
- ‚Ç¨101-125
- ‚Ç¨126-150
- ‚Ç¨151+

**Question 4:** At what price would you consider certified soft skills assessment to be a **bargain‚Äîa great buy for the money**?
- ‚Ç¨0-25
- ‚Ç¨26-50
- ‚Ç¨51-75
- ‚Ç¨76-100
- ‚Ç¨101+

### How to Analyze Results

**Step 1:** Plot all 4 questions on a graph (X-axis = price, Y-axis = % of respondents)

**Step 2:** Find intersections:
- **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** "Too cheap" crosses "Expensive"
- **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** "Too expensive" crosses "Bargain"
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** "Too cheap" crosses "Too expensive"
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP):** "Expensive" crosses "Bargain"

**Step 3:** Optimal price range = Between PMC and PME

**Example Result:**
```
If analysis shows:
- PMC = ‚Ç¨45
- OPP = ‚Ç¨79
- IPP = ‚Ç¨95
- PME = ‚Ç¨125

‚Üí Optimal price range: ‚Ç¨45-125
‚Üí Recommended price: ‚Ç¨79-99 (at OPP/IPP)
```

---

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ **PASS if:** Optimal price range includes ‚Ç¨99 (¬±‚Ç¨20)
‚ö†Ô∏è **RECONSIDER if:** Optimal price < ‚Ç¨60 (consider ‚Ç¨49 instead)
‚ùå **FAIL if:** "Too expensive" threshold < ‚Ç¨50 (students won't pay, make it free)

## üö™ PART 3: Fake Door Test

### What It Is
Add "Get Certified" button to current InTransparency platform (even though feature doesn't exist yet). Measure click-through rate and collect waitlist signups.

### Implementation

**Step 1: Add CTA to Student Dashboard**

```tsx
// Add this card to /app/dashboard/student/page.tsx

<Card className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-blue-600 text-white">
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>üéì Get Certified. Stand Out.</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Complete a certified soft skills assessment and unlock:
    </p>
    <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
      <li>‚úÖ Certification badge on your profile</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Priority in recruiter search results</li>

    </div>
    <Button
      variant="secondary"
      size="lg"
      onClick={() => router.push('/certification-waitlist')}
    >
      Get Certified Now
    </Button>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

---

**Step 2: Create Waitlist Page**

```tsx
// Create /app/certification-waitlist/page.tsx

export default function CertificationWaitlist() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto p-8 text-center">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">
        Soft Skills Certification Coming Soon!
      </h1>
      <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">
        We're launching certified psychometric assessments in the next 2 months.
        Join the waitlist for early access and exclusive pricing.
      </p>

      <Card>
        <CardContent className="p-8">
          <form>
            <Label>Email</Label>
            <Input type="email" placeholder="your@email.com" />

            <Label className="mt-4">Why do you want certification?</Label>

        ‚úì No spam, we promise
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

**Step 3: Track Metrics**

**Measure:**
- **Dashboard CTR:** What % of students click "Get Certified"?
- **Waitlist Signups:** How many actually join waitlist?
- **Price Selection:** What price do they select?
- **Motivation:** Why do they want certification?

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ **>10% CTR** on dashboard CTA ‚Üí Strong interest
- ‚úÖ **>50% of clickers** join waitlist ‚Üí Purchase intent validated
- ‚úÖ **>40% select** ‚Ç¨99 or ‚Ç¨150+ ‚Üí Price point validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5-10% CTR** ‚Üí Moderate interest, test further
- ‚ùå **<5% CTR** ‚Üí Low interest, reconsider feature

---

## üí≥ PART 4: Pre-Order Campaign (Advanced)

### What It Is
Actually collect money BEFORE building the feature. If users pre-pay, you know demand is real.

### Setup

**Landing Page Offer:**
> "Pre-order soft skills certification for ‚Ç¨79 (‚Ç¨20 off launch price of ‚Ç¨99).
> Get certified when we launch in 2 months. Full refund if unsatisfied."

**Payment Flow:**
1. User clicks "Pre-Order for ‚Ç¨79"
2. Stripe payment page (collect ‚Ç¨79)
3. Confirmation email: "You're in! We'll email you when certification launches."
4. Add to database as "pre-order customer"

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Real money** = real validation (not just "I'd pay" survey answers)
- ‚úÖ **Upfront revenue** (fund development)
- ‚úÖ **Commitment** (pre-order customers will complete assessment)

**Risks:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal obligation to deliver or refund
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reputation damage if you don't launch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Stripe integration (dev time)

---

### Success Criteria

**Target:** 100 pre-orders in 4 weeks = ‚Ç¨7,900 revenue

**GO if:** >100 pre-orders
- Proves demand
- ‚Ç¨7,900 funds initial development
- 100 beta users to test with

**NO-GO if:** <25 pre-orders
- Low confidence in demand
- Risk not justified
- Refund the 25 customers, pivot to free

---

## üìà PART 5: Pricing Anchoring Experiments

### Concept: Decoy Pricing

Present 3 options where middle option looks like best value (even if it's expensive).

### Test Pricing Page Design

**Option 1: Anchoring Test A**

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basic | FREE | 3 projects, basic visibility |
| **Certified** | **‚Ç¨99** | ‚úÖ Certification, unlimited projects, analytics |
| Premium+ | ‚Ç¨199 | Everything + 1-on-1 career coaching |

**Hypothesis:** ‚Ç¨199 "Premium+" makes ‚Ç¨99 look like a bargain

---

**Option 2: Anchoring Test B**

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | ‚Ç¨0 | 3 projects |
| **Student Pro** | **‚Ç¨9/month** | Unlimited projects, certification |
| Enterprise | ‚Ç¨500/year | For companies (wrong audience for students) |

**Hypothesis:** ‚Ç¨500 enterprise tier anchors students to think ‚Ç¨9/mo is cheap

---

**Option 3: Anchoring Test C (Subscription vs One-Time)**

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | ‚Ç¨0 | Basic |
| Monthly Premium | ‚Ç¨12/month | All features, cancel anytime |
| **Lifetime Certified** | **‚Ç¨99 one-time** | All features, LIFETIME access, certification |

**Hypothesis:** ‚Ç¨99 one-time looks like better value than ‚Ç¨12/mo (breaks even in 8 months)

---

### How to Test

**Run A/B/C test on pricing page:**
- 33% see Test A (‚Ç¨99 vs ‚Ç¨199)
- 33% see Test B (‚Ç¨9/mo vs ‚Ç¨500)
- 33% see Test C (‚Ç¨12/mo vs ‚Ç¨99 one-time)

**Measure:** Which test converts best?

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ If Test A or C converts best ‚Üí ‚Ç¨99 one-time is optimal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If Test B converts best ‚Üí Consider ‚Ç¨9/mo recurring instead
- ‚ùå If all fail ‚Üí Price too high, test ‚Ç¨49

---

## üí¨ PART 6: Customer Development Interviews (Pricing Focus)

### Pricing-Specific Interview Questions

**Ask 20 students who completed profile:**

**Q1:** "If we added a certified soft skills assessment, how much do you think it should cost?"
- _Don't provide options, let them anchor first_

**Q2:** "Would you pay ‚Ç¨99 one-time for certification if it helped you get hired faster?"
- If YES: "Why? What would make it worth ‚Ç¨99?"
- If NO: "What price would be fair?" / "What if it was ‚Ç¨49?"

**Q3:** "Would you prefer ‚Ç¨99 one-time or ‚Ç¨9 per month?"
- _Test subscription vs one-time preference_

**Q4:** "What's the most you've ever paid for a career-related tool or service?"
- _Understand their spending behavior_

**Q5:** "If your university offered this certification for free, would you still use InTransparency if we charged ‚Ç¨99?"
- _Test price sensitivity vs alternatives_

---

### Success Criteria

**Target:** 20 interviews, find patterns

‚úÖ **GO if:**
- >60% say they'd pay ‚Ç¨99
- >50% prefer one-time over subscription
- Average "fair price" = ‚Ç¨75-125

‚ùå **NO-GO if:**
- <30% willing to pay ‚Ç¨99
- Average "fair price" = <‚Ç¨40
- Strong preference for free

---

## üéØ PART 7: Consolidated Decision Framework

### Pricing Validation Scorecard

| Experiment | Success Criteria | Result | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|
| **Van Westendorp Survey** | Optimal price range includes ‚Ç¨99 (¬±‚Ç¨20) | ‚Ç¨___ | ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail |

| **Customer Interviews** | >60% willing to pay ‚Ç¨99 | ___% | ‚¨ú Pass / ‚¨ú Fail |

---

### Final Pricing Decision Matrix

**Scenario 1: ALL TESTS PASS (4/5 or 5/5)**
‚Üí **GO with ‚Ç¨99 one-time** ‚úÖ
- High confidence in pricing
- Launch with ‚Ç¨99, offer ‚Ç¨79 early bird discount
- Expected conversion: 5-8%

**Scenario 2: MODERATE SUCCESS (3/5 tests pass)**
‚Üí **GO with ‚Ç¨49-79** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Some willingness to pay, but ‚Ç¨99 might be high
- Test lower price point (‚Ç¨49 or ‚Ç¨79)
- Expected conversion: 8-12%

**Scenario 3: WEAK RESULTS (2/5 or fewer tests pass)**
‚Üí **Pivot to subscription model** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Try ‚Ç¨9/month instead of ‚Ç¨99 one-time
- Lower barrier, recurring revenue
- Expected conversion: 3-5%

**Scenario 4: ALL TESTS FAIL (0/5 or 1/5)**
‚Üí **Make it FREE, monetize elsewhere** ‚ùå
- Students won't pay for soft skills certification
- Keep it free, differentiate with features
- Charge recruiters more instead (‚Ç¨199/mo instead of ‚Ç¨149/mo)
