## ü•á OPTION 1: Pymetrics (TOP RECOMMENDATION)

### Company Overview
- **Founded:** 2013
- **HQ:** New York, USA
- **Funding:** $100M+ raised
- **Customers:** 50+ Fortune 500 (Unilever, Accenture, LinkedIn, Kraft Heinz)
- **Technology:** AI-powered neuroscience games

### What They Offer
**Product:** Soft skills assessment through gamified neuroscience tasks
- 12 interactive games (~25 minutes total)
- Measures 90+ cognitive & behavioral traits
- AI matches candidates to roles
- **No adverse impact** (bias-free, EEOC certified)

### How It Works
1. Candidate plays 12 games (attention, memory, risk, emotion, etc.)
2. Pymetrics AI analyzes behavioral patterns
3. Scores 90+ traits (not just Big Five)
4. Matches to job profiles

### Example Games
- **Balloons:** Risk tolerance (pump balloons without popping)
- **Towers:** Planning & problem-solving (Hanoi towers puzzle)
- **Money Exchange:** Trust & fairness (economic game)
- **Digits:** Working memory (remember number sequences)

### Pros ‚úÖ
- **Best-in-class science** - Peer-reviewed, neuroscience-based
- **EEOC compliant** - Legally defensible, no bias
- **Engaging UX** - Games > boring questionnaires (better completion rates)
- **Trusted brand** - LinkedIn uses them (credibility)
- **API available** - White-label integration possible

### Cons ‚ùå
- **25 minutes long** - Students might not complete (vs 10-15 min for Big Five)
- **B2B focus** - No existing B2C pricing (need custom deal)
- **Expensive** - Likely ‚Ç¨5-10 per test or 20-30% revenue share
- **Less transparent** - 90+ traits = harder to explain to students

### Integration Approach

**Option A: White-Label API**
```
InTransparency ‚Üí Pymetrics API ‚Üí Student takes games ‚Üí Results returned
```
- Students don't see "Pymetrics" branding
- InTransparency displays results in custom UI
- Payment handled by InTransparency

**Option B: Redirect to Pymetrics**
```
InTransparency ‚Üí Redirect to Pymetrics portal ‚Üí Student completes ‚Üí Return with results
```
- Less integration work
- Pymetrics branding visible
- May feel disconnected from InTransparency

### Pricing Models to Negotiate

**Model 1: Per-Test Licensing**
- ‚Ç¨5-10 per student assessment
- InTransparency pays Pymetrics for each test
- InTransparency charges students ‚Ç¨99 (‚Ç¨89-94 profit margin)

**Model 2: Revenue Share**
- 20-30% of certification revenue
- ‚Ç¨99 √ó 30% = ‚Ç¨30 to Pymetrics, ‚Ç¨69 to InTransparency
- Lower upfront cost, easier negotiation

**Model 3: Flat Subscription**
- ‚Ç¨500-2,000/month for unlimited tests
- Makes sense if >50-200 students/month (depends on price)

### Deal Structure Proposal

**Pitch to Pymetrics:**
> "We're launching a B2C student certification platform (InTransparency) targeting 20M students globally.
> You have no B2C offering. We can be your student market channel.
>
> **Proposed Deal:**
> - White-label API access
> - ‚Ç¨7 per test OR 25% revenue share
> - Minimum 500 tests in first 6 months
> - We handle all student acquisition & payment
> - You provide API, validation docs, support
>
> **Win-Win:**
> - You: New B2C revenue stream, zero student acquisition cost
> - Us: Fast launch, validated tests, EEOC compliance"

### Contact Information
- **Website:** pymetrics.com
- **API Docs:** pymetrics.com/developers
- **Business Contact:** partnerships@pymetrics.com
- **Likely Decision Maker:** VP of Partnerships or Head of Product

### Next Steps with Pymetrics
1. Email partnerships@pymetrics.com with pitch
2. Request API demo & pricing
3. Negotiate revenue share (target: <25%)
4. Sign partnership agreement (review legal terms)
5. Integrate API (2-4 weeks dev time)
6. Beta test with 50 students
7. Launch certification with Pymetrics backend

### Risk Mitigation
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Pymetrics says no or pricing too high
**Mitigation:** Fallback to Criteria Corp (Option 2)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Students don't complete 25-minute assessment
**Mitigation:** Offer shorter Big Five alternative (Option 6: Open-Source)

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Partnership Inquiry - B2C Student Certification Platform

Hi Criteria Team,

We're building InTransparency, a student career platform launching in Europe with
20,000+ students in our early access list.

We want to offer certified soft skills assessments and are evaluating providers.

Would you be open to a B2C partnership where:
- We white-label your CPI, EQ, and cognitive tests
- Pay per-test (target: ‚Ç¨20 per bundle) OR revenue share (25%)
- We handle student acquisition, you provide validated tests + API

Could we schedule a 30-min call to discuss?

Best,
[Your Name]
InTransparency Founder
```

### Risk Mitigation
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Tests too expensive (>‚Ç¨25 per student)
**Mitigation:** Negotiate bulk pricing or revenue share instead

---

## üü° OPTION 3: HackerRank Skills (Technical Only)

### Why Consider HackerRank?
**NOT for soft skills**, but could **complement** InTransparency's offering

### What They Offer
- Technical coding challenges
- Pre-built assessments (Python, JavaScript, SQL, etc.)
- Coding interview platform
- Skill certifications

### Integration Scenario
**Combined Offering:**
- InTransparency Certification = **Verified Projects** + **Soft Skills (Pymetrics)** + **Technical Tests (HackerRank)**
- All-in-one package: ‚Ç¨149 one-time

### Pros ‚úÖ
- Gold standard for technical assessment
- 17M+ developer community (credibility)
- API available
- Complements soft skills (holistic profile)

### Cons ‚ùå
- Zero soft skills assessment
- Expensive (‚Ç¨100-500/month for companies)
- Students can already use HackerRank for free

### Verdict
‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT a soft skills partner**, but consider for future "Premium Plus" tier

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTION 4: 16Personalities (Not Recommended for Hiring)

### What They Offer
- Free personality test (Myers-Briggs alternative)
- 16 personality types (INTJ, ENFP, etc.)

- ‚Ç¨29 premium reports

### Pros ‚úÖ
- **FREE** basic test (low cost)
- Hugely popular (100M+ tests taken)
- Fun, shareable results (viral potential)
- API available

### Cons ‚ùå
- **NOT scientifically rigorous** (criticized by psychologists)
- **NOT validated for hiring** (EEOC concerns)
- **Entertainment > Assessment** (not trusted by serious recruiters)
- **Self-reported** (no behavioral validation)

### Why This is Risky
**Legal Issue:** Using non-validated personality tests for hiring decisions can violate EEOC guidelines
**Credibility Issue:** Recruiters won't trust results ("This is just BuzzFeed for personality")

### Verdict
‚ùå **DO NOT USE for certification**
‚úÖ **Could use as fun icebreaker** (separate from certification)

---

## üî¥ OPTION 5: Wonderlic (Cognitive Only, Expensive)

### What They Offer
- Cognitive ability test (12 min, 50 questions)
- Used in NFL draft (famous)

- **Not essential** for soft skills certification

### Verdict
üî¥ **SKIP** - Too expensive, not core to soft skills

---

## üü¢ OPTION 6: Open-Source Big Five (Budget Option)

### What It Is
Use open-source Big Five personality framework (public domain)

### How It Works
1. License open-source Big Five questionnaire (IPIP-NEO-120)

### Cons ‚ùå
- **Not as prestigious** (vs "Powered by Pymetrics")
- **Requires validation** (need psychologist to certify)
- **EEOC risk** (need legal review to ensure compliance)
- **Development time** (4-6 weeks to build + validate)

### Implementation

**Step 1: License IPIP-NEO Questions**
- International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) is public domain
