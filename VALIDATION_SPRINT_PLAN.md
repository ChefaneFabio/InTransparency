## üö¶ DECISION GATES (Day 60)

### SCENARIO A: ‚úÖ FULL GO (Probability 25-30%)
**Conditions:**
- 2+ ITS willing to share course-level data
- 5+ companies willing to pay ‚Ç¨10/contact
- Clear path to pilot execution

**Action:**
- Sign data sharing agreements with ITS
- Build pilot with 1 ITS + 50-100 students
- Onboard 5-10 paying companies
- Build course-level filtering feature
- Raise pre-seed funding (‚Ç¨100-200K) if possible

**Moat:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4-5 years defendability)
**Success odds:** 35-45% (regional ‚Ç¨3-8M/year business)

---

### SCENARIO B: ‚ö†Ô∏è PIVOT (Probability 40-50%)
**Conditions:**
- 0-1 ITS willing to share granular data (GDPR/policy blocks)
- But 5+ companies interested in basic verified profiles
- Market interest exists but data access limited

**Action:**
- PIVOT to simpler model:
  - Drop course-level granularity (too hard to get)
  - Focus on project verification only (easier to get)
  - Become "GitHub for all disciplines" (not course-grade platform)
- Lower pricing: ‚Ç¨5/contact (less value without course data)
- Adjust value prop: "Verified projects" not "verified course performance"

**Moat:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (1-2 years defendability)
**Success odds:** 20-30% (smaller ‚Ç¨500K-2M/year business)

---

### SCENARIO C: ‚ùå MAJOR PIVOT OR SHUTDOWN (Probability 20-30%)
**Conditions:**
- No institutional data access
- Companies not willing to pay (prefer free Indeed/LinkedIn)
- Value prop doesn't resonate

**Action:**
- MAJOR PIVOT:
  - Option 1: SaaS for career services (‚Ç¨500/year per institution)
  - Option 2: Different market (international students? Bootcamps?)
  - Option 3: Shutdown, cut losses, learn

**Moat:** ‚≠ê (6-12 months)
**Success odds:** <10%

## üéØ REMEMBER: THIS IS A VALIDATION, NOT EXECUTION PHASE

**You are NOT building the platform yet. You are de-risking the biggest assumptions:**

1. ‚ùì Can we get institutional data? ‚Üí Answer in 2 weeks
2. ‚ùì Will companies pay? ‚Üí Answer in 6 weeks

**If both = YES:** You have a 35-45% chance at a ‚Ç¨3-8M/year business. GO!
**If 1 = NO:** Pivot to simpler model (20-30% chance, smaller business)
**If both = NO:** Major pivot or shutdown to save time/money.

**This 60-day sprint could save you 1-2 years of building the wrong thing. That's the goal.**
