## üîç How Verification Works

### **Triple-Layer Verification System**

#### **Layer 1: Project Work** (What they built)
- Student uploads project (GitHub repo, PDF, images, etc.)
- AI analyzes project quality based on discipline
- Generates complexity, innovation, and relevance scores

#### **Layer 2: Academic Context** (Where they learned it)
- Student links project to a specific **course**
- Includes **course code**, **semester**, **professor**, **grade**
- Shows this was real academic work, not fabricated

#### **Layer 3: University Verification** (Institutional proof)
- Professor endorses project via email verification
- University admin can verify course exists and grade is accurate
- Sets `universityVerified = true` flag
- Highest credibility level

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### **Database Migration**
```bash
# After updating schema.prisma
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### **Backwards Compatibility**
- All existing TECHNOLOGY projects remain valid
- Old projects have `discipline = TECHNOLOGY` by default
- `technologies` and `githubUrl` fields still work for tech projects
- No breaking changes to existing data

### **File Upload Strategy**
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: URL-only (students paste image/video URLs)
2. **Phase 2**: S3/Cloudflare integration for file uploads
   - PDFs: Max 10MB
   - Images: Max 5MB each
   - Videos: Max 100MB or external links
   - CAD files: Max 50MB

### **AI Analysis Strategy**
Each discipline needs custom analysis:

```typescript
// Example: Business Project Analysis
async function analyzeBusinessProject(project: Project) {
  const prompt = `
    Analyze this business project:
    Title: ${project.title}
    Description: ${project.description}

    Rate on:
    1. Financial Rigor (0-100): How sound is the financial analysis?
    2. Strategic Thinking (0-100): How well does it address strategic questions?
    3. Market Analysis Depth (0-100): How thorough is the market research?
    4. Presentation Quality (0-100): How professionally is it presented?
  `

  const response = await openai.complete(prompt)
  return {
    complexityScore: response.financialRigor,
    innovationScore: response.strategicThinking,
    marketRelevance: response.marketAnalysisDepth
  }
}
```

## üîë Key Takeaways

### **What Changed**
1. **From tech-only to all disciplines** (15 disciplines supported)
2. **From project-only to course+grade+project** (academic verification)
3. **From GitHub-only to files+media** (PDFs, images, videos, CAD)
4. **From 5% to 100% of students** (all majors can use platform)
5. **From ‚Ç¨21B to ‚Ç¨68.2B TAM** (3.2x market expansion)

### **Why It Matters**
- **Students**: Can showcase ANY academic work, not just code
- **Recruiters**: Can find candidates across ALL disciplines
- **Universities**: Can verify ALL courses, not just CS
- **Revenue**: 13.6x growth potential

### **Critical Innovation**
The **triple-layer verification system** (project + course + university) makes InTransparency more credible than LinkedIn self-reported skills AND more accessible than GitHub code-only portfolios.

---

**Platform Vision**: InTransparency is no longer just for developers. It's the universal academic-to-professional bridge for ALL students across ALL disciplines, verified through coursework and grades, not just self-reported skills.
